- I use AI to code just as I use the semi-autonomous driving feature in my Tesla.
- I use AI to help me brainstorm about a problem.
- I use AI in the same way that I use a car's satnav to plan a journey.
- I finally decided to go open source (and it's both easy and extremely difficult).
- I don't think we're going to be replaced by AI, at least not if we behave like Dorothy Vaughan in Hidden Figures (and no, this isn't a love letter to Fortran).
