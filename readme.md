# Web3 Lab

This repository is my personal **Web3 knowledge lab**.  
It contains my notes, experiments, and study material about blockchain, Ethereum, Solidity, and smart contract security.

> ⚠️ This repo is not a polished product, it is a learning-in-public repository, it is a living knowledge base that evolves as I learn.  
> If you see something wrong or confusing, I’d really appreciate an issue or PR so I can fix it and learn from it.

## Goals

- Build a reusable **knowledge base** for Web3 development (Ethereum, L2s, DeFi, NFTs, security).
- Document the main **concepts, patterns, and pitfalls** encountered while learning and building smart contracts.
- Maintain a public trace of my **learning process and experiments** in 2026 and beyond.


## About the format

All notes are written in Markdown and organized as an Obsidian vault.  
Some content is in French, but all file and folder names, as well as technical terms, are in English to keep the repo accessible to an international audience.


## Disclaimer

- This is a **learning repository**. Some notes may be incomplete, outdated, or experimental.  
- Nothing here should be considered financial advice or production-ready security guidance.  
- Feel free to get inspiration from the structure, but always double‑check concepts in official documentation before using them in real-world projects.
