# Custodial vs Non-Custodial Wallets

Who controls the private keys? That's the difference for a [[wallet]].

**Custodial** = the company holds your keys (Coinbase, Binance, etc.). Like a bank account - easy to use, but if they get hacked or freeze your account, you're screwed. You don't really own it.

**Non-custodial** = you hold the keys (MetaMask, Ledger, etc.). You're in control, but lose your seed phrase and it's gone forever. This is real ownership.

Most people use custodial for trading, non-custodial for storing. Start with custodial, move to non-custodial once you're holding anything serious.
