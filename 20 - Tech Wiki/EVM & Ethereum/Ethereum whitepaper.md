This protocol was conceived and designed in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, at the age of 19. Realizing how difficult it was to implement new features on Bitcoin, he published a description of his Ethereum project as a white paper and in a 2013 [blog post](http://web.archive.org/web/20131228111141/http://vbuterin.com/ethereum.html) titled “Ethereum: [The Ultimate Smart Contract and Decentralized Application Platform](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1iESOknlAeAHBOHfSetKe8Qj32-vLLZtl).”

To fund the project’s development, Vitalik Buterin pre-sold the first ethers in a public token sale called an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), where participants could buy ether tokens in exchange for bitcoin or fiat currency — you will develop an ICO smart contract during your training.

The sale enabled him to raise 31,529 bitcoins, worth more than $18 million at the time, in exchange for 60 million ethers. Thanks to this sale, the Ethereum blockchain was launched on July 30, 2015.

In 2016, the Ethereum White Paper was published. You can read the original version [here](https://whitepaper.io/document/5/ethereum-whitepaper) or the translated version [here](https://www.ethereum-france.com/livre-blanc-white-paper-ethereum-traduction-francaise/).

### The difference between Ethereum and ether

The Ethereum protocol uses a unit called the ether, which is the currency underpinning this technology. “Ethereum” refers to the network itself, while ether (or ETH) is the native currency used on this blockchain.

While Bitcoin was designed to evolve finance, Ethereum was designed to evolve the web.
