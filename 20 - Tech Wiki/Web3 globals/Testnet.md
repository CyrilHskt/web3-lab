A network that mirrors the main network ([[Mainnet]]) but is dedicated to testing with **non-valuable** tokens.

For example, **Sepolia** is an Ethereum testnet. To get test tokens, you typically use a [[Faucet]] to fund your [[Wallet]].

Be careful not to confuse testnets: Ethereum’s testnets are different from the testnets of its Layer 2 networks (e.g., Optimism or Arbitrum).
