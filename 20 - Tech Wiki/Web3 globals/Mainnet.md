The **mainnet** is the live, production blockchain network where transactions have **real economic value** and are permanently recorded on-chain.

Using mainnet typically requires paying network fees ([[gas]]) and operating with real assets via a [[Wallet]].

Unlike a [[Testnet]], mainnet actions are generally **irreversible** and should be performed with extra caution.
